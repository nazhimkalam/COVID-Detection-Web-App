			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
				coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It has since spread
				worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.
			</p>
			<p>
				Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of
				smell and taste. Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. Around one in five infected
				individuals do not develop any symptoms.While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute
				respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
			</p>
			<p>
				The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person.
				Small droplets and aerosols containing the virus can spread from an infected person's nose and mouth as they
				breathe, cough, sneeze, sing, or speak. Other people are infected if the virus gets into their mouth, nose or
				eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The virus may also spread via contaminated surfaces, although this is not thought to be the main route of
				transmission. The exact route of transmission is rarely proven conclusively, but infection mainly happens when
				people are near each other for long enough.
